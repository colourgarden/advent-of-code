# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). The solutions are written in JavaScript using Node.js.

## How to run

To run these solutions, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Navigate to a `year/dayX` directory and run `node index.js` and the solution will be printed to the console.

The content of `input.txt` is my personal puzzle input from Advent of Code.
